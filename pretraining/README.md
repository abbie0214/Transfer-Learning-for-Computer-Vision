# Pretraining Models for MNIST and CIFAR classifications

Run ```run_experiments.sh``` for all the experiments. This will also generate the graphs. Run ```python main.py -h``` in
CIFAR and MNIST directories to know about allowed options such as ```finetune``` and ```use_transfer```. To change the
locations where graphs and graph values would be generated, change the corresponding variables in the code.
