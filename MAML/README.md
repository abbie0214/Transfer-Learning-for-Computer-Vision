# Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)

Run ```sine_reg.py``` to implement MAML for sinusoidal regression.

The code will generate the tasks given the range of uniform distribution.
The model is given in ```model.py```

## Not included in report

Run ```lin_reg.py``` to get visualize the movement of the parameters in 2D.

Run ```gen_tasks.py``` to see what generating tasks from the same distribution
means in the context of sinusoids.
